		<h4>Summary:</h4>
		<p>Dragon's Greed is a fantasy dice game played by several players. The objective of the game is to either accumulate the highest number of points by the end of a predetermined number of rounds or be the first player to reach a specific target number of points.
		</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div id="gameplay">
		<h4>Gameplay:</h4>
		<p>1. At the start of each round, all players roll three six-sided dice (D6).
		</p>
		<p>2. The sum of the numbers rolled on the three dice determines the initial value of a player's hand.
		</p>
		<p>3. Players can choose to be satisfied with their initial hand and not roll any additional dice, or they can opt to roll two or more dice in an attempt to improve their hand.
		</p>
		<p>4. The goal is to get as close as possible to a value of 18 without exceeding it. If a player's hand exceeds 18, they bust and are eliminated from the round.
		</p>
		<p>5. After all players have decided whether to roll additional dice or remain with their initial hand, the round progresses to the next phase.
		</p>
		<p>6. The value of each player's hand that did not bust is added to their final tally for the game.
		</p>
		<p>7. The game continues for the agreed-upon number of rounds or until a player reaches the predetermined target number of points.

		<h4>Points and Scoring:</h4>
		<p>1. Points are awarded only to the players who did not bust during a round.
		</p>
		<p>2. The value of the surviving hand determines the points earned by each player.
		</p>
		<p>3. The player's final tally is updated after each round by adding the value of their surviving hand to their score.
		</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div id="wincondition">
		<h4>Determining the Winner:</h4>
		<p>1. There are two ways to determine the winner, depending on mutual agreement among the players:
		</p>
		<p> a) Highest Total Points: The game is played for a set number of rounds, and the player with the highest total points at the end of the rounds is declared the winner. (The game sample uses this condition.)</p>
		<p> b) Target Points: The game continues until one player reaches the agreed-upon target number of points first. That player is then declared the winner.</p>
