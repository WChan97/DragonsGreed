        <h4>Rules</h4>
        <p>The aim of this game is to be the first to reach a decided number of points first, or have the highest out of a number of rounds. Each round, players must try to get as close to, but never exceeding a value of 18 for their hand. Certain conditions can change the outcome of the full game.</p>
        <p>Below describes a turn by turn round of a game.</p>
        <p>All players roll three D6, and the value of the hand is the sum of all three numbers. This is the first phase of a round.</p>
        <p>Players can choose to roll two or more D6 in an attempt to get a higher valued hand. Players can also choose to be satisfied with their first hand, and not roll additional dice. This is the second phase of a round.</p>
        <p>A players hand must not exceed 18, or else that player busts and is except from that round.</p>
        <p>After all incidents have resolved, each players hands value is added onto their final tally.</p>
        <p>This repeats until the decided number of turns have been met, or points have been achieved.</p>
